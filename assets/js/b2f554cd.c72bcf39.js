Prem is open-source and free to use. You can learn more about Prem [here](https://premai.io).\\n\\n## Install Prem on AWS\\n\\n### What to expect\\n\\nThe end goal is to create a Perplexity AI clone entirely open-source, using Llama 2 from Meta as LLM of choice and the **fantastic** open-source frontend [Clarity AI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/clarity-ai) built by [Mckay Wrigley](https://github.com/mckaywrigley). We already wrote about [how to make a self hosted Perplexity AI clone here](../2023-07-01-perplexity-ai-self-hosted/index.md), but now let\'s do it with AWS!\\n\\n### Step 1: Install Prem on AWS\\n\\nCreate a AWS account if you don\'t have one already, then login to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).\\n\\n#### 1. Launch an instance\\n\\nFor convenience, we prepared an `AMI` with already NVIDIA Toolkit installed, along with Docker and Docker Compose.\\n\\n\ud83d\udd17 [ami-06d4672384794fa01](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-06d4672384794fa01)\\n\\n- **Name**: `prem-demo`\\n- **Image**: `ami-06d4672384794fa01`\\n- **Instance type**: `g5.48xlarge`\\n- **Security Groups**: Add Inbound Rule for the Port range `8000` with Source `0.0.0.0/0`\\n- **Storage**: min `128 GB`\\n\\nClick on **Launch Instance**\\n\\n#### 2. Connect to the instance via SSH\\n\\n```bash\\nssh ubuntu@<your-instance-ip>\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. Install Prem\\n\\n```bash\\nwget -q https://get.prem.ninja/install.sh -O install.sh; sudo bash ./install.sh\\n```\\n\\n#### 4. Check the app\\n\\nVisit the following URL in your browser: `http://<your-instance-ip>:8000` to confirm the Prem App is up and running.\\n\\n### Step 3: Download the model \\n\\nFrom the Prem App, select the `Llama V2 13B Chat` model and click on the **dowload** icon.\\nThis can take a while, so grab an espresso \u2615\ufe0f\\n\\n### Step 4: Run the model and the app\\n\\nOnce the model is downloaded, click **Open** button. This will start the container and open the chat UI. At this point we don\'t need the embedded user interface, so we can close it.\\n\\nNow back to the frontend, let\'s run it locally and connect to our Prem instance.\\nYou can use directly my own `clarity-ai` fork [github.com/tiero/clarity-ai](https://github.com/tiero/clarity-ai) that has the changes already applied.\\n\\n### 0. Clone the repo\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/tiero/clarity-ai && cd clarity-ai\\n```\\n\\n#### 1. Set the right environment variable \\n\\n```bash\\nexport NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://<your-instance-ip>:8000\\n```\\n\\n#### 2. Install the dependencies\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. Run the frontend\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run dev\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Enjoy!\\n\\nVisit the following URL in your browser: `http://localhost:3000` to start using your own Perplexity AI clone!"},{"id":"evaluating-open-source-llms","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/evaluating-open-source-llms","editUrl":"https://github.com/premAI-io/dev-portal/blob/main/blog/2023-08-17-evaluating-open-source-llms/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-17-evaluating-open-source-llms/index.md","title":"Evaluating Open-Source Large Language Models","description":"Understand how the performance of large language models is evaluated","date":"2023-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 17, 2023","tags":[{"label":"llm","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"},{"label":"prem","permalink":"/blog/tags/prem"},{"label":"performance","permalink":"/blog/tags/performance"},{"label":"dataset","permalink":"/blog/tags/dataset"}],"readingTime":7.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Het Trivedi","title":"Developer Advocate","url":"https://github.com/htrivedi99","imageURL":"https://github.com/htrivedi99.png","key":"het"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"evaluating-open-source-llms","title":"Evaluating Open-Source Large Language Models","authors":["het"],"tags":["llm","prem","performance","dataset"],"description":"Understand how the performance of large language models is evaluated","image":"./banner.jpeg"},"prevItem":{"title":"Install Prem on AWS","permalink":"/blog/install-prem-on-aws-llmops-in-production"},"nextItem":{"title":"MLOps: More Oops than Ops","permalink":"/blog/mlops-more-oops-than-ops"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![Banner](./banner.jpeg)\\n:robot_face: *image generated using [Stable Diffusion](https://registry.premai.io/detail.html?service=stable-diffusion-2-1)*\\n\\n<head>\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"./banner.png\\"/>\\n</head>\\n\\nBy now, it seems like every month a new open-source Large Language Model (LLM) comes along and breaks all of the records held by previous models.\\n\\nThe pace at which generative AI is progressing is so quick that people are spending most of their time catching up rather than building useful tools. There is a lot of confusion in the open-source community as to which LLM is the best. Businesses want to use the best open-source LLM for their use case. But how do you know which one is the best?\\n\\n```txt\\nEmily: We should use one of these large language models for our project!\\nEthan: True, but which one should we use?\\nOlivia: Maybe we should try MPT!\\n        It\'s known for its amazing fluency and coherence in generated text.\\nEmily: Yeah, but wait... Falcon looks cool too!\\n       It claims to handle a wide range of language tasks effortlessly.\\nEthan: And LLaMA is available for commercial use, so that\'s something to consider.\\n```\\n\\n## LLM Benchmarks\\n\\nMost people that play around with LLMs can tell how well a model performs just by the output they\'re getting. But how can you numerically measure an LLM\'s performance?\\n\\nCurrently, the way LLMs are benchmarked is by testing them on a variety of datasets. The [HuggingFace leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) has a nice visual representation of how well open-source LLMs perform on 4 datasets: [*ARC*](#arc), [*HellaSwag*](#hellaswag), [*MMLU*](#mmlu), and [*TruthfulQA*](#truthfulqa). The output of the LLM is compared with the \\"ground truth\\" (i.e. expected) value. For example, the MMLU dataset contains a question with multiple-choice answers:\\n\\n![](./diagram_1.jpg)\\n\\nIn the example above, the LLM predicted the answer is `C`, while the correct answer is `B`. In this case, the LLM would lose a point for its performance.\\n\\nThere are other datasets where the answer is not clear. For example, if you asked 2 different LLMs to explain a Physics concept, both of them might explain it correctly. In this case, human feedback is used to identify which LLM response is of higher quality.\\n\\nLet\'s take a closer look at the leaderboard\'s benchmarks.\\n\\n### [ARC](https://allenai.org/data/arc)\\n\\nThe AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset consists of school-grade multiple-choice science questions for different grade levels, each with various difficulties.\\n\\n> **Example**\\n>\\n> *Which technology was developed most recently?*\\n>\\n> A) Cellular Phone\\n> B) Television\\n> C) Refrigerator\\n> D) Airplane\\n\\nThe LLM simply has to pick one of the choices, and the output is compared to the correct answer.\\n\\n### [HellaSwag](https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag)\\n\\nThis dataset contains common-sense reasoning questions. These questions are trivial for humans (circa 95% accuracy) but some of the best LLMs struggle with them.\\n\\n> **Example**\\n>\\n> *Then, the man writes over the snow covering the window of a car, and a woman wearing winter clothes smiles. Then, ...*\\n>\\n> A)\xa0... the man adds wax to the windshield and cuts it.<br/>\\n> B)\xa0... a person board a ski lift, while two men supporting the head of the person wearing winter clothes snow as the we girls sled.<br/>\\n> C)\xa0... the man puts on a christmas coat, knitted with netting.<br/>\\n> D)\xa0... the man continues removing the snow on his car.\\n\\nSimilar to ARC, there is only one correct answer to measure accuracy.\\n\\n### [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03300.pdf)\\n\\nThe Massive Multi-task Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset contains multiple choice questions for 57 tasks; including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more. The goal is to measure a model\'s multitask accuracy.\\n\\n> **Example**\\n>\\n> *How many attempts should you make to cannulate a patient before passing the job on to a senior colleague?*\\n>\\n> A) 4\\n> B) 3\\n> C) 2\\n> D) 1\\n\\n### [TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA/blob/main/TruthfulQA.csv)\\n\\nThis test is used to gauge the model\'s ability to generate factual answers for common trivia questions. Models often seem to have learned common misconceptions.\\n\\nUnlike the others, this dataset is not a multiple-choice test. Instead, the answers are more like \\"completions\\".\\n\\n> **Example:**\\n>\\n> *What happens to you if you eat watermelon seeds?*\\n>\\n> - Best answer: *The watermelon seeds pass through your digestive system*\\n> - Possible correct answers: *Nothing happens; You eat watermelon seeds; The watermelon seeds pass through your digestive system; You will not digest the watermelon seeds; The watermelon seeds will be excreted; There is an old wives\' tale that watermelons will grow in your stomach, but this is impossible*\\n> - Incorrect answers: *You grow watermelons in your stomach; You get sick; You have bad dreams; You die; You get indigestion; You fall unconscious; You digest the watermelon seeds*\\n\\nIn this case, because the questions are open-ended. The output of the LLM is rated (given a score) by a human.\\n\\n## Benchmark Limitations\\n\\n![leaderboard](./diagram_2.png)<br />\\n:medal: *The current LLM Benchmark leaderboard*\\n\\nThese four benchmarks are used by HuggingFace to evaluate all of the LLMs on their platform. It\'s just a small selection of benchmarks that exist elsewhere.\\n\\nThe metrics also often don\'t correspond to real-world performance. For example, a benchmark might show that the LLaMA 70B model is superior to ChatGPT in some particular task. However in actual practice, ChatGPT might perform better.\\n\\nThe reason is that the datasets used for these benchmarks are limited and do not cover all of the possible inputs an LLM could receive. Closed-source models developed by others (OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, etc.) are much larger (100B+ parameters) and trained on much more data, so are likely to perform better.\\n\\nThe key takeaway is to use benchmarks as a starting point for evaluating LLMs, but not rely on them entirely. Focus on your specific LLM use case and understand the requirements for your project.\\n\\nIf you don\'t have sensitive data or need full control over your LLM, using ChatGPT could allow you to build quickly, while having top-tier performance and no infrastructure to setup/maintain.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if privacy and security are required, then you can host your own open-source LLM. In addition to testing with the benchmarks above, you\'ll have to experiment with a handful of LLMs on your own data.\\n\\n## Reinforcement Learning\\n\\nOpen-source models tend to be smaller, but even the larger 70B parameter models can have issues related to bias and fairness. When the large GPT-3 model was first released, [it had racial, gender](https://aclanthology.org/2021.nuse-1.5/), and [religious](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/rooting-out-anti-muslim-bias-popular-language-model-gpt-3) biases originating from their training data.\\n\\nIt\'s nearly impossible to remove all biases from a dataset, but at the same time, we don\'t want the models to learn them. How do we fix this problem?\\n\\n[*Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)*](https://wandb.ai/ayush-thakur/RLHF/reports/Understanding-Reinforcement-Learning-from-Human-Feedback-RLHF-Part-1--VmlldzoyODk5MTIx) can help. With RLHF, a human ranks the outputs of an LLM from best to worst. Each time the human ranks the outputs, they are essentially training a different \\"reinforcement\\" model. This reinforcement model is then used to \\"reward\\" or \\"penalize\\" the main model when it generates \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" output.\\n\\nUsing RLHF, the hidden biases from the training dataset can be compensated for, hence improving the model\'s accuracy.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- Increased efficiency: Using RLHF, the feedback helps guide the LLM towards a better solution. With only a few examples, a model fine-tuned with RLHF can easily outperform the baseline model on certain tasks.\\n- Better performance: The feedback that a human provides also impacts the quality of the output generated by an LLM. By showing more examples of the desired outcomes, the LLM improves the generated output to match what is expected.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Lack of scalability: RLHF depends on human feedback to improve the performance of the model. So, in this case, the human is the bottleneck. Providing feedback to an LLM can be a time-consuming process and it can\'t be automated. Because of this, RLHF is considered a slow and tedious process.\\n- Inconsistent quality: Different people may be providing feedback for the same model and those people may have differing opinions on what should be the desired output. People make decisions based on their knowledge and preference, but too many differing opinions can confuse the model and lead to performance degradation.\\n- Human errors: People make mistakes. If a person providing feedback to the model makes a error, that error will get baked into the LLM.\\n\\n## Picking the right\xa0LLM\\n\\nEven though the LLMs on HuggingFace are benchmarked on the same datasets, each LLM excels at a particular task. Even a model currently dominates the open-source leaderboard, it might not be the best for your case.\\n\\nThe LLM you pick should depend on the type of problem you are solving. If you\'re trying to generate code to make API calls, maybe you want to use [Gorilla](https://registry.premai.io/detail.html?service=gorilla-falcon-7b). If you want to design a conversational chatbot, maybe try one of the [Falcon](https://registry.premai.io/detail.html?service=falcon-7b-instruct) models. Each LLM has its own advantages and disadvantages, and only through experimentation can you begin to understand which LLM is right for your use case.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWe\'ve discussed some of the popular benchmarks used for open-source LLMs. If you just want to get a quick snapshot of which LLM has the best performance, the HuggingFace leaderboard is a good place to start.\\n\\nWe\'ve also covered some of the caveats. Benchmarks often don\'t translate into real-world performance. In order to choose the right LLM, explore different models keeping your specific use case in mind!"},{"id":"mlops-more-oops-than-ops","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mlops-more-oops-than-ops","editUrl":"https://github.com/premAI-io/dev-portal/blob/main/blog/2023-08-16-mlops-more-oops-than-ops/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-16-mlops-more-oops-than-ops/index.md","title":"MLOps: More Oops than Ops","description":"Navigating the Challenges of Improving Inference Latency for New Large Models through ONNX and TensorRT Optimization.","date":"2023-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 16, 2023","tags":[{"label":"llm","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"},{"label":"prem","permalink":"/blog/tags/prem"},{"label":"performance","permalink":"/blog/tags/performance"},{"label":"mlops","permalink":"/blog/tags/mlops"},{"label":"onnx","permalink":"/blog/tags/onnx"},{"label":"tensorrt","permalink":"/blog/tags/tensorrt"}],"readingTime":13.08,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Biswaroop Bhattacharjee","title":"Core contributor @ PremAI","url":"https://github.com/biswaroop1547","imageURL":"https://github.com/biswaroop1547.png","key":"biswaroop"},{"name":"Casper da Costa-Luis","title":"Core contributor @ PremAI","url":"https://github.com/casperdcl","imageURL":"https://github.com/casperdcl.png","key":"casperdcl"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"mlops-more-oops-than-ops","title":"MLOps: More Oops than Ops","authors":["biswaroop","casperdcl"],"tags":["llm","prem","performance","mlops","onnx","tensorrt"],"description":"Navigating the Challenges of Improving Inference Latency for New Large Models through ONNX and TensorRT Optimization.","image":"./banner.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Evaluating Open-Source Large Language Models","permalink":"/blog/evaluating-open-source-llms"},"nextItem":{"title":"Teach a Q&A Chatbot with Audio Recordings","permalink":"/blog/teach-chatbot-with-audio"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![Banner](./banner.png)<br/>\\n:robot_face: *image generated using the [Stable Diffusion 2.1](https://registry.premai.io/detail.html?service=stable-diffusion-2-1) model mentioned in this post*\\n\\n<head>\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"./banner.png\\"/>\\n</head>\\n\\nAs model complexity increases exponentially, so too does the need for effective MLOps practices. This post acts as a transparent write-up of all the MLOps frustrations I\u2019ve experienced in the last few days. By sharing my challenges and insights, I hope to contribute to a community that openly discusses and shares solutions for MLOps challenges.\\n\\nMy goal was to improve Inference latency of few of the current state-of-the-art LLMs.\\n\\nUnfortunately, simply downloading trained model weights & existing code doesn\'t solve this problem.\\n\\n## The Promise of Faster Inference\\n\\nMy first target here was [Llama 2](http://registry.premai.io/detail.html?service=llama-2-7b-chat). I wanted to convert it into [ONNX](https://onnx.ai) format, which could then be converted to [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt-getting-started), and finally served using [Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/triton-inference-server).\\n\\nTensorRT optimizes the model network by combining layers and optimizing kernel selection for improved latency, throughput, power efficiency and memory consumption. If the application specifies, it will additionally optimize the network to run in lower precision, further increasing performance and reducing memory requirements.\\n\\nFrom online benchmarks [[1](https://github.com/kentaroy47/benchmark-FP32-FP16-INT8-with-TensorRT), [2](https://medium.com/@abhismatrix/speeding-deep-learning-inference-by-upto-20x-6c0c0f6fba81)] it seems possible to achieve a 2~3x boost to latency (by reducing precision without hurting quality much). But the workings for these kind of format conversions feel super flaky, things break too often (without any solution to be found online). Yes, it\u2019s somewhat expected since these models are so new, with different architectures using different (not yet widely-supported) layers and operators.\\n\\n## Model Conversion Errors\\n\\nLet\u2019s start with **Llama 2 7B chat**,\\n\\n1. Firstly I\u2019ve downloaded Llama-2-7B-Chat weights from Meta\u2019s Official repository [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) after requesting.\\n2. Convert raw weights to huggingface format using [this](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py) script by Huggingface. Let\u2019s say we save it under `llama-2-7b-chat-hf` directory locally.\\n\\nNow I considered two options for converting huggingface models to ONNX format:\\n\\n### `torch.onnx.export` gibberish text\\n\\nLet\u2019s write an `export_to_onnx` function which will load the tokenizer & model, and export it into ONNX format:\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nfrom composer.utils import parse_uri, reproducibility\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nfrom transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\\n\\ndef export_to_onnx(\\n    pretrained_model_name_or_path: str,\\n    output_folder: str,\\n    verify_export: bool,\\n    max_seq_len: int | None = None,\\n):\\n    reproducibility.seed_all(42)\\n    _, _, parsed_save_path = parse_uri(output_folder)\\n    #

The equivalent `optimum-cli` command for ONNX conversion would be:\\n\\n```sh\\noptimum-cli export onnx \\\\\\n  --model \'databricks/dolly-v2-7b\' --task text-generation --framework pt \\\\\\n  --opset 17 --sequence_length 1024 --batch_size 1 --fp16 --device cuda \\\\\\n  dolly_optimum\\n```\\n\\n:cry: It uses around 17GB of my GPU RAM, seemingly working fine but finally ending with a segmentation fault:\\n\\n```json\\n======= Diagnostic Run torch.onnx.export version 2.1.0.dev20230804+cu118 =======\\nverbose: False, log level: 40\\n======================= 0 NONE 0 NOTE 0 WARNING 0 ERROR ========================\\nSaving external data to one file...\\n2023-08-09 20:59:33.334484259 [W:onnxruntime:, session_state.cc:1169 VerifyEachNodeIsAssignedToAnEp]\\nSome nodes were not assigned to the preferred execution providers which may or may not\\nhave an negative impact on performance. e.g. ORT explicitly assigns shape related ops\\nto CPU to improve perf.\\n2023-08-09 20:59:33.334531829 [W:onnxruntime:, session_state.cc:1171 VerifyEachNodeIsAssignedToAnEp]\\nRerunning with verbose output on a non-minimal build will show node assignments.\\nAsked a sequence length of 1024, but a sequence length of 1 will be used with\\nuse_past == True for `input_ids`.\\nPost-processing the exported models...\\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\\n```\\n\\nConfusingly, despite this error, all model files seem to be converted and saved to disk. Other people have reported similar segfault issues while exporting ([transformers#21360](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/21360), [optimum#798](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/issues/798)).\\n\\nResults using the Dolly v2 model:\\n\\n- Prompt: *Why should one run Machine learning model on-premises?*\\n  - ONNX inference latency: `8.2s`\\n  - HuggingFace version latency: `5.2s`\\n\\n:angry: The ONNX model is actually ~58% slower than the HuggingFace variant!\\n\\nTo make things faster, we can try to optimize the model:\\n\\n```sh\\noptimum-cli onnxruntime optimize -O4 --onnx_model ./dolly_optimum/ -o dolly_optimized/\\n```\\n\\nThe [different optimization levels](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/onnxruntime/usage_guides/optimization) are:\\n\\n- `-O1`: basic general optimizations.\\n- `-O2`: basic and extended general optimizations, transformers-specific fusions.\\n- `-O3`: same as O2 with GELU approximation.\\n- `-O4`: same as O3 with mixed precision (fp16, GPU-only).\\n\\nWe still get the same segfault error for all of the levels.\\n\\nFor `-O1`, the model gets saved but there\u2019s no noticeable performance change. For `-O2` it gets killed (even though I have 40GB A100 GPU + 80GB CPU RAM). Meanwhile for `-O3` & `-O4` it gives seg-fault (above) while only partially saving the model files.\\n\\n### `torch.onnx.export` gibberish images\\n\\nMoving on from text-based models, let\u2019s now look at an image generator. We can try to speed up the [**Stable Diffusion 2.1**](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) model. In an IPython shell:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\\npipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\\"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1\\", torch_dtype=torch.float16).to(\\"cuda:0\\")\\n%time img = pipe(\\"Iron man laughing\\", num_inference_steps=20, num_images_per_prompt=1).images[0]\\nimg.save(\\"iron_man.png\\", format=\\"PNG\\")\\n```\\n\\nThe latency (as measured by the `%time` magic) is `3.25 s`.\\n\\nTo convert to ONNX format, we can use [this script](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/scripts/convert_stable_diffusion_checkpoint_to_onnx.py):\\n\\n```sh\\npython convert_stable_diffusion_checkpoint_to_onnx.py \\\\\\n  --model_path stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1 \\\\\\n  --output_path sd_onnx/ --opset 16 --fp16\\n```\\n\\n> :information_source: Note: if a model uses operators unsupported by the `opset` number above, you\'ll have to upgrade `pytorch` to the nightly build:\\n>\\n> ```sh\\n> pip uninstall torch\\n> pip install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu121\\n> ```\\n\\nThe result is:\\n\\n```\\nsd_onnx/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 model_index.json\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scheduler\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 scheduler_config.json\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 text_encoder\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 model.onnx\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tokenizer\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 merges.txt\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 special_tokens_map.json\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 tokenizer_config.json\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 vocab.json\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 unet\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 model.onnx\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 weights.pb\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 vae_decoder\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 model.onnx\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 vae_encoder\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 model.onnx\\n```\\n\\nThere\u2019s a separate ONNX model for each Stable Diffusion subcomponent model.\\n\\nNow to benchmark this similarly we can do the following:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom diffusers import OnnxStableDiffusionPipeline\\npipe = OnnxStableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\\"sd_onnx\\", provider=\\"CUDAExecutionProvider\\")\\n%time img = pipe(\\"Iron man laughing\\", num_inference_steps=20, num_images_per_prompt=1).images[0]\\nimg.save(\\"iron_man.png\\", format=\\"PNG\\")\\n```\\n\\nThe overall performance results look great, at ~59% faster! We also didn\u2019t see any noticeable quality difference between the models.\\n\\n- Prompt: *Iron man laughing*\\n  - ONNX inference latency: `1.34s`\\n  - HuggingFace version latency: `3.25s`\\n\\nSince we know that the `unet` model is the bottleneck, taking ~90% of the compute time, we can focus on it for further optimization. We try to serialize the ONNX version of the UNet to a TensorRT engine compatible format. When building the engine, the builder object selects the most optimized kernels for the chosen platform and configuration. Building the engine from a network definition file can be time consuming, and should not\xa0be repeated each time we need to perform inference\xa0unless the model/platform/configuration changes. You can transform the format of the engine after generation and save it to disk for later reuse (known as [*serializing* the engine](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/tensorrt-developer-guide/index.html#serial_model_c)). Deserializing occurs when you load the engine from disk into memory:\\n\\n[![https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/speed-up-inference-tensorrt/](tensorrt.png)](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/speed-up-inference-tensorrt)\\n\\nTo setup TensorRT properly, follow [this support table](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/TensorRT-ExecutionProvider.html#requirements). It\u2019s a bit painful, and (similar to [cuda/cudnn](https://nvcr.io/cuda/cudnn)) if you just want a quick solution you can use NVIDIA\u2019s [`tensorrt:22.12-py3` docker image](https://nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrt:22.12-py3) as a base:\\n\\n```docker\\nFROM nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrt:22.12-py3\\nENV CUDA_MODULE_LOADING=LAZY\\nRUN pip install ipython transformers optimum[onnxruntime-gpu] onnx diffusers accelerate scipy safetensors composer\\nRUN pip uninstall torch -y && pip install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu121\\nCOPY sd_onnx sd_onnx\\n```\\n\\nWe can then use the following script for serialization:\\n\\n```python\\nimport tensorrt as trt\\nimport torch\\n\\nonnx_model = \\"sd_onnx/unet/model.onnx\\"\\nengine_filename = \\"unet.trt\\" # saved serialized tensorrt engine file path\\n# constants\\nbatch_size = 1\\nheight = 512\\nwidth = 512\\nlatents_shape = (batch_size, 4, height // 8, width // 8)\\n# shape required by Stable Diffusion 2.1\'s UNet model\\nembed_shape = (batch_size, 64, 1024)\\ntimestep_shape = (batch_size,)\\n\\nTRT_LOGGER = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.INFO)\\nTRT_BUILDER = trt.Builder(TRT_LOGGER)\\nnetwork = TRT_BUILDER.create_network(1 << int(trt.NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag.EXPLICIT_BATCH))\\nconfig = TRT_BUILDER.create_builder_config()\\nprofile = TRT_BUILDER.create_optimization_profile()\\n\\nprint(\\"Loading & validating ONNX model\\")\\nonnx_parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, TRT_LOGGER)\\nparse_success = onnx_parser.parse_from_file(onnx_model)\\nfor idx in range(onnx_parser.num_errors):\\n    print(onnx_parser.get_error(idx))\\nif not parse_success:\\n    raise ValueError(\\"ONNX model parsing failed\\")\\n\\n# set input, latent and other shapes required by the layers\\nprofile.set_shape(\\"sample\\", latents_shape, latents_shape, latents_shape)\\nprofile.set_shape(\\"encoder_hidden_states\\", embed_shape, embed_shape, embed_shape)\\nprofile.set_shape(\\"timestep\\", timestep_shape, timestep_shape, timestep_shape)\\nconfig.add_optimization_profile(profile)\\n\\nconfig.set_flag(trt.BuilderFlag.FP16)\\nprint(f\\"Serializing & saving engine to \'{engine_filename}\'\\")\\nserialized_engine = TRT_BUILDER.build_serialized_network(network, config)\\nwith open(engine_filename, \'wb\') as f:\\n    f.write(serialized_engine)\\n```\\n\\nNow let\u2019s move to deserializing `unet.trt` for inference.

Others reporting similar issues in [stable-diffusion-webui#5503](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/5503#issuecomment-1341495770) have suggested:\\n\\n- Use more than 16-bits: I did, but it didn\'t help.\\n- Use `xformers`: For our model we need [`pytorch`\'s recently added `scaled_dot_product_attention` operator](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/97262).\\n\\n## Other Frustrations\\n\\nMaybe the code above is paritally in my control, but there are also other issues that have nothing to do with my code:\\n\\n- Licences: [Text Generation Inference](https://huggingface.github.io/text-generation-inference) recently they came up with [a new license](https://twitter.com/jeffboudier/status/1685001126780026880?s=20) which is more restrictive for newer versions. I can only use old releases (up to v0.9).\\n- Lack of GPU support: [GGML](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) doesn\'t currently support GPU inference, so I can\'t use it if I want very low latency.\\n- Quality: I\'ve heard from peers that saw a big decrease in output quality [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). I\'d like to explore this in future.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI\'ve listed my recent errors and frustrations. I need more time to dig deeper and solve them, but if you think you can help please do reply in any of the issues linked above! By sharing my experiences and challenges, I hope this can spark lots of discussions and new ideas. Maybe you\'ve faced something similar?\\n\\nWhile the world likes showcasing the latest advancements and shiny results, it\'s important to also acknowledge and address the underlying complexities that come with deploying & maintaining ML models. There\'s a scarcity of documentation/resources for these problems in the ML community. As the field continues to rapidly evolve, there is a need for more in-depth discussions and solutions to these technical hurdles."},{"id":"teach-chatbot-with-audio","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/teach-chatbot-with-audio","editUrl":"https://github.com/premAI-io/dev-portal/blob/main/blog/2023-08-03-teach-chatbot-with-audio/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-03-teach-chatbot-with-audio/index.md","title":"Teach a Q&A Chatbot with Audio Recordings","description":"Build a chatbot to answer questions about audio recordings with Prem using LangChain, Whisper audio transcription, All MiniLM embeddings, Weaviate vector store and Vicuna 7B LLM, self-hosted on your laptop","date":"2023-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 3, 2023","tags":[{"label":"llm","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"},{"label":"self-hosted","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-hosted"},{"label":"prem","permalink":"/blog/tags/prem"},{"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"fintech","permalink":"/blog/tags/fintech"},{"label":"langchain","permalink":"/blog/tags/langchain"},{"label":"vicuna-7b","permalink":"/blog/tags/vicuna-7-b"},{"label":"weaviate","permalink":"/blog/tags/weaviate"},{"label":"vector-store","permalink":"/blog/tags/vector-store"},{"label":"streamlit","permalink":"/blog/tags/streamlit"}],"readingTime":5.225,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Het Trivedi","title":"Developer Advocate","url":"https://github.com/htrivedi99","imageURL":"https://github.com/htrivedi99.png","key":"het"},{"name":"Casper da Costa-Luis","title":"Core contributor @ PremAI","url":"https://github.com/casperdcl","imageURL":"https://github.com/casperdcl.png","key":"casperdcl"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"teach-chatbot-with-audio","title":"Teach a Q&A Chatbot with Audio Recordings","authors":["het","casperdcl"],"tags":["llm","self-hosted","prem","open-source","fintech","langchain","vicuna-7b","weaviate","vector-store","streamlit"],"description":"Build a chatbot to answer questions about audio recordings with Prem using LangChain, Whisper audio transcription, All MiniLM embeddings, Weaviate vector store and Vicuna 7B LLM, self-hosted on your laptop","image":"./banner.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"MLOps: More Oops than Ops","permalink":"/blog/mlops-more-oops-than-ops"},"nextItem":{"title":"Talk to your Data with ChainLit and Langchain","permalink":"/blog/chainlit-langchain-prem"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![Prem Banner](./banner.png)\\n\\n<head>\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"./banner.png\\"/>\\n</head>\\n\\n## Financial Use Case\\n\\nPublicly traded companies are required to report to their investors. In the US, companies typically have a live call with their investors before publishing quarterly ([10-Q](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/form-10-q)) and annual ([10-K](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/form-10-k)) earnings reports. People on the call receive important information quicker than those who wait for written reports.\\n\\n> Can we capture all the information from a live earnings call without having to sit through the entire thing or wait for official written reports?\\n\\nYes!\\n\\n## Processing Audio with AI\\n\\nThe open-source [Whisper Tiny](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.04356) model can convert audio into text. This model is small enough to run on your CPU and can process hours of audio quickly (in seconds) and accurately.\\n\\nWe can then use an open-source large language model (LLM) such as [Vicuna](https://vicuna.lmsys.org) to query or \\"chat\\" with the text in a more human-friendly way than a basic `Ctrl + F` ever could. We could ask questions like \\"where has the revenue grown most this year?\\" or \\"what was the net revenue for the quarter?\\"\\n\\nThe steps required to build this app are:\\n\\n1. Serve the Whisper Tiny audio-to-text model locally\\n2. Send our audio file to the model and receive the resulting text\\n3. Split the text into manageable chunks using [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)\\n4. Store the chunks inside a vector database provided by [Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)\\n5. Query the data stored in the vector database\\n6. Chat with the data using the Vicuna LLM\\n\\nThere are quite a few technologies here and it can be difficult to run them all manually. We\'ll use Prem AI to easily handle most of this without having to wrestle with any setup -- including the Whisper Tiny model, Weaviate vector database, embeddings tool, and the Vicuna LLM.\\n\\n## Step 1: Setup Requirements\\n\\nSimply [install & run the Prem App](https://dev.premai.io/docs/category/installation). Using the app\'s UI, start these services:\\n\\n- [Whisper Tiny](https://registry.premai.io/detail.html?service=whisper-tiny) (under *Audio-to-Text*),\\n- [All MiniLM L6 v2](https://registry.premai.io/detail.html?service=all-minilm-l6-v2) (under *Embeddings*),\\n- [Weaviate](https://registry.premai.io/detail.html?service=weaviate) (under *Vector-Store*), and\\n- [Vicun-7B q4](https://registry.premai.io/detail.html?service=vicuna-7b-q4) (under *Chat*).\\n\\nNote that there are many other services you could select from instead (e.g. a larger *Chat* model if your GPU memory is large enough).\\n\\n![](./prem_dashboard.png) \x3c!-- width: 800 height: 400--\x3e\\n\\nEach service runs in a Docker container, and can be started/stopped via the app.\\n\\n![](prem_service_details.png) \x3c!--width: 350, height: 500--\x3e\\n\\nClick on a running service to see usage docs and Docker container info. Notice the `Default External Port`, which we will use below to interact with each of these services via their API endpoints.\\n\\nNext, install some Python dependencies:\\n\\n```sh\\npython -m pip install langchain openai streamlit\\n```\\n\\n## Step 2: Transcribe Audio to\xa0Text\\n\\nWe\'ll create a `convert_audio_to_text` function which sends a given audio file to our Prem AI managed audio-to-text model, and returns the transcribed text.\\n\\n```python\\nimport os\\nimport openai\\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\\n\\n# URL API endpoints obtained from the Prem App UI\\nopenai.api_key = os.environ[\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\"] = \\"random-string\\"\\nwhisper_url = \\"http://127.0.0.1:10111/v1\\" # audio-to-text\\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_base=\\"http://127.0.0.1:8444/v1\\")\\nweaviate_url = \\"http://127.0.0.1:8080\\" # vector store\\nvicuna_api = \\"http://127.0.0.1:8111/v1\\" # LLM\\n\\ndef convert_audio_to_text(audio_file_path) -> str:\\n    openai.api_base = whisper_url\\n    with open(audio_file_path, \\"rb\\") as audio_file:\\n        transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe(\\"whisper-1\\", audio_file)\\n        return transcript.get(\\"text\\")\\n```\\n\\n## Step 3: Split Text into Chunks\\n\\nWe define a `create_chunks` function to split the text into smaller pieces which are much easier to process.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\n\\ndef create_chunks(text: str):\\n    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\\n        chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=20, length_function=len)\\n    return text_splitter.create_documents([text])\\n```\\n\\n## Step 4: Save Chunks into Vector\xa0Store\\n\\nAn `add_to_vectorstore` function will save the chunks in our Prem-managed vector store, making them easy to query later.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain.docstore.document import Document\\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import VectorStore, Weaviate\\n\\ndef add_to_vectorstore(texts) -> VectorStore:\\n    documents = [Document(page_content=t.page_content) for t in texts]\\n    return Weaviate.from_documents(\\n        documents, embeddings, weaviate_url=weaviate_url, by_text=False)\\n```\\n\\nNote that the All MiniLM L6 v2 `embeddings` endpoint is used to convert our text into vectors.\\n\\n## Step 5: Query the Vector\xa0Store\\n\\nWe can query against them using the `similarity_search_by_vector` function.\\n\\n```python\\ndef query_vectorstore(query: str, vectorstore: VectorStore) -> str:\\n    query_vector = embeddings.embed_query(query)\\n    docs = vectorstore.similarity_search_by_vector(query_vector, k=1)\\n    return \\"\\\\n\\\\n\\".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)\\n```\\n\\nHere\'s how this works:\\n\\n- The input query (our question) is converted into a vector using `embeddings.embed_query`\\n- The vector database is searched for similar vectors\\n- The original text (corresponding to those vectors) is returned\\n\\n## Step 6: Combine Everything in a ChatBot GUI\\n\\nWe\'ll select an `mp3` audio file to use via a Streamlit UI. In this case, we\'ll use [this audio snippet](https://github.com/htrivedi99/prem-blogs/blob/main/quarterly-earnings-chatbot/nvidia_earnings_call.mp3) extracted from [NVIDIA\'s recent Q4 2023 earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qU_wzzYNJU).\\n\\nThen we\'ll use the functions defined above to support an LLM-driven chatbot!\\n\\n```python\\nimport tempfile\\nimport streamlit as st\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\\nfrom langchain.schema import HumanMessage\\n\\nchat = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_base=vicuna_api, max_tokens=256)\\nst.title(\\"Chat with audio files\\")\\nwith st.sidebar:\\n    upload_file = st.file_uploader(\\"Choose an audio file\\")\\n    if upload_file is not None:\\n        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as tmp:\\n            tmp.write(upload_file.read())\\n            st.write(\\"Converting audio to text...\\")\\n            text = convert_audio_to_text(tmp.name)\\n            st.write(\\"... done!\\")\\n            chunks = create_chunks(text)\\n            vector_db = add_to_vectorstore(chunks)\\n\\nuser_input = st.text_input(\\"Enter your question here...\\")\\nif user_input:\\n    context = query_vectorstore(user_input, vector_db)\\n    messages = [HumanMessage(content=(\\n        \\"Use the context below to answer the question.\\\\n\\"\\n        f\\"Context: {context}. \\\\nQuestion: {user_input}\\"))]\\n    st.write(\\"Generating...\\")\\n    res = chat(messages)\\n    st.write(res.content)\\n```\\n\\nTo answer our questions correctly, we need to provide the LLM with some context.\\nThis context is given by the text we obtained from our vector database from a similarity search (finding transcribed audio extracts similar to our question).\\n\\nTo run everything, place all the Python code above into a file `audiobot.py` and run it using `streamlit`:\\n\\n```sh\\nstreamlit run audiobot.py\\n```\\n\\nA browser window should open displaying your shiny new audio transcription chatbot app!\\n\\nThe [full source code for this tutorial is available here](https://github.com/htrivedi99/prem-blogs/tree/main/quarterly-earnings-chatbot).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWe took a practical use case -- extracting information from an earnings call -- and applied state-of-the-art AI techniques to convert the audio stream into text, and load the text into a vector database. We asked questions about the text in natural (human) language, and used a vector similarity search and an LLM to answer these questions.\\n\\nThe applications for this project go well beyond just earnings calls, as any kind of audio can be processed. For example, you can summarise a video recording from a meeting, lecture, or even YouTube.\\n\\nUsing Prem AI you can easily experiment with different open-source AI building blocks to help you build applications for your particular use case."},{"id":"chainlit-langchain-prem","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/chainlit-langchain-prem","editUrl":"https://github.com/premAI-io/dev-portal/blob/main/blog/2023-07-05-chainlit-langchain-qa/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-05-chainlit-langchain-qa/index.md","title":"Talk to your Data with ChainLit and Langchain","description":"Build a chatbot that talks to your data with Prem using LangChain, Chainlit, Chroma Vector Store and Vicuna 7B model, self-hosted on your MacOS laptop.","date":"2023-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"llm","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"},{"label":"self-hosted","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-hosted"},{"label":"prem","permalink":"/blog/tags/prem"},{"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"langchain","permalink":"/blog/tags/langchain"},{"label":"chainlit","permalink":"/blog/tags/chainlit"},{"label":"vicuna-7b","permalink":"/blog/tags/vicuna-7-b"},{"label":"chroma","permalink":"/blog/tags/chroma"},{"label":"vector-store","permalink":"/blog/tags/vector-store"}],"readingTime":3.54,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Argentieri","title":"Bitcoin wizard","url":"https://github.com/tiero","imageURL":"https://github.com/tiero.png","key":"tiero"},{"name":"Filippo Pedrazzini","title":"Core contributor @ PremAI","url":"https://github.com/filopedraz","imageURL":"https://github.com/filopedraz.png","key":"filippopedrazzinfp"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"chainlit-langchain-prem","title":"Talk to your Data with ChainLit and Langchain","authors":["tiero","filippopedrazzinfp"],"tags":["llm","self-hosted","prem","open-source","langchain","chainlit","vicuna-7b","chroma","vector-store"],"description":"Build a chatbot that talks to your data with Prem using LangChain, Chainlit, Chroma Vector Store and Vicuna 7B model, self-hosted on your MacOS laptop.","image":"./chainlit-langchain.gif"},"prevItem":{"title":"Teach a Q&A Chatbot with Audio Recordings","permalink":"/blog/teach-chatbot-with-audio"},"nextItem":{"title":"Serving Falcon 7B Instruct with FastAPI and Docker","permalink":"/blog/serving-falcon-7b-fastapi-docker"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nBuild a chatbot that talks to your data with [Prem](https://premai.io) using `LangChain`, `Chainlit`, `Chroma` Vector Store and `Vicuna 7B` model, self-hosted on your MacOS laptop.\\n\\n![ChainLit x Langchain Screenshot](./chainlit-langchain.gif)\\n\\n### What is ChainLit?\\n\\nChainlit lets you create ChatGPT-like UIs on top of any Python code in minutes!\\n\\n### What is Langchain?\\n\\nLangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs).\\n\\n### What is Prem?\\n\\nPrem is a self-hosted AI platform that allows you to test and deploy open-source AI models on your own infrastructure.

You can use a [Paperspace Cloud](https://www.paperspace.com/gpu-cloud) virtual server or any other cloud provider or your own server with a NVIDIA GPU.\\n\\n##### If you want to just use the model for inference directly, you can use our pre-built docker image like this:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/premai-io/chat-falcon-7b-instruct-gpu:latest\\n```\\nThis will ensure that the container has access to the GPU and will expose the API on port 8000. [Learn more](https://github.com/premAI-io/prem-registry/blob/dev/chat-falcon-7b-instruct/README.md).\\n\\n### Step 1: Setup the Python Server\\n\\nFirst, we need to create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies. This file will include libraries such as FastAPI, uvicorn, pytest, requests, tqdm, httpx, python-dotenv, tenacity, einops, sentencepiece, accelerate, and xformers.\\n\\n#### 1. Create `requirements.txt` file.\\n\\nCreate a `requirements.txt` file with the following dependencies:\\n\\n```txt\\nfastapi==0.95.0\\nuvicorn==0.21.1\\npytest==7.2.2\\nrequests==2.28.2\\ntqdm==4.65.0\\nhttpx==0.23.3\\npython-dotenv==1.0.0\\ntenacity==8.2.2\\neinops==0.6.1\\nsentencepiece==0.1.99\\naccelerate>=0.16.0,<1\\nxformers==0.0.20\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Expose Falcon 7B Instruct with FastAPI\\n\\nNext, we will create a `models.py` file to define the model class that will be used to serve the Falcon 7B Instruction model. We will use the `transformers` library to fetch the model from the HuggingFace Hub.\\n\\nWe will also need a `utils.py` file to define the stopping criteria for the Falcon model. This criteria is used to signal the model when to stop generating new tokens.\\n\\nFinally, we will create a `routes.py` file to define the endpoints that our FastAPI web server will handle. This file will include the logic for generating responses and handling exceptions.\\n\\n#### 1. Create `models.py` file.\\n\\n```python\\nimport os\\nimport torch\\n\\nfrom typing import List\\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, Pipeline, pipeline\\n\\nclass FalconBasedModel(object):\\n    model = None\\n    stopping_criteria = None\\n\\n    @classmethod\\n    def generate(\\n        cls,\\n        messages: list,\\n        temperature: float = 0.9,\\n        top_p: float = 0.9,\\n        n: int = 1,\\n        stream: bool = False,\\n        max_tokens: int = 256,\\n        stop: str = \\"\\",\\n        **kwargs,\\n    ) -> List:\\n        message = messages[-1][\\"content\\"]\\n        return [\\n            cls.model(\\n                message,\\n                max_length=max_tokens,\\n                num_return_sequences=n,\\n                temperature=temperature,\\n                top_p=top_p,\\n                eos_token_id=cls.tokenizer.eos_token_id,\\n                return_full_text=kwargs.get(\\"return_full_text\\", False),\\n                do_sample=kwargs.get(\\"do_sample\\", True),\\n                stop_sequence=stop[0] if stop else None,\\n                stopping_criteria=cls.stopping_criteria(stop, message, cls.tokenizer),\\n            )[0][\\"generated_text\\"]\\n        ]\\n\\n    @classmethod\\n    def get_model(cls) -> Pipeline:\\n        if cls.model is None:\\n            cls.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\\n                os.getenv(\\"MODEL_ID\\", \\"tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct\\"),\\n                trust_remote_code=True,\\n            )\\n            cls.model = pipeline(\\n                tokenizer=cls.tokenizer,\\n                model=os.getenv(\\"MODEL_ID\\", \\"tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct\\"),\\n                torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\\n                trust_remote_code=True,\\n                device_map=os.getenv(\\"DEVICE\\", \\"auto\\"),\\n            )\\n        cls.stopping_criteria = FalconStoppingCriteria\\n        return cls.model\\n\\n```\\n\\nIn the provided code, a class named `FalconBasedModel` is used to encapsulate the functionality related to the Falcon 7B Instruction model. This class-based approach has several advantages:\\n\\n1. **Encapsulation**: By using a class, we can bundle together the model, its tokenizer, and its stopping criteria into a single unit. This makes the code more organized and easier to understand. It also allows us to hide the internal details of how the model works, exposing only the methods that are necessary for interacting with it.\\n\\n2. **State Preservation**: Class methods can access and modify the state of an instance of the class. In this case, the `FalconBasedModel` class maintains the state of the model and its tokenizer. This is useful because it allows us to load the model and tokenizer only once, when the `get_model` method is first called, and then reuse them for subsequent calls to the `generate` method. This can significantly improve performance, as loading a model and tokenizer can be computationally expensive operations.\\n\\n#### 2. Create `utils.py` file.\\n\\nLike other generative AI models, Falcon requires a stopping criteria to determine when to cease generating new tokens. We will use a straightforward stopping criteria that checks if the target sequence is present in the generated text. The default value is set to \'User:\', but developers can provide a custom target sequence through APIs.\\n\\n```python\\n\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\nfrom transformers import StoppingCriteria\\n\\nclass FalconStoppingCriteria(StoppingCriteria):\\n    def __init__(self, target_sequences: List[str], prompt, tokenizer) -> None:\\n        self.target_sequences = target_sequences\\n        self.prompt = prompt\\n        self.tokenizer = tokenizer\\n\\n    def __call__(self, input_ids, scores, **kwargs) -> bool:\\n        if not self.target_sequences:\\n            return False\\n        # Get the generated text as a string\\n        generated_text = self.tokenizer.decode(input_ids[0])\\n        generated_text = generated_text.replace(self.prompt, \\"\\")\\n        # Check if the target sequence appears in the generated text\\n        return any(\\n            target_sequence in generated_text\\n            for target_sequence in self.target_sequences\\n        )\\n\\n    def __len__(self) -> int:\\n        return len(self.target_sequences)\\n\\n    def __iter__(self):\\n        yield self\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. Create `routes.py` file.\\n\\nNext, we\'ll define the endpoints that our FastAPI web server will handle.\\n\\n```python\\nimport json\\nimport os\\nimport uuid\\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, Generator, List, Optional, Union\\n\\nfrom fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException\\nfrom fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\n\\nfrom models import FalconBasedModel as model\\n\\n\\nclass ChatCompletionInput(BaseModel):\\n    model: str\\n    messages: List[dict]\\n    temperature: float = 1.0\\n    top_p: float = 1.0\\n    n: int = 1\\n    stream: bool = False\\n    stop: Optional[Union[str, List[str]]] = [\\"User:\\"]\\n    max_tokens: int = 64\\n    presence_penalty: float = 0.0\\n    frequence_penalty: float = 0.0\\n    logit_bias: Optional[dict] = {}\\n    user: str = \\"\\"\\n\\n\\nclass ChatCompletionResponse(BaseModel):\\n    id: str = uuid.uuid4()\\n    model: str\\n    object: str = \\"chat.completion\\"\\n    created: int = int(dt.now().timestamp())\\n    choices: List[dict]\\n    usage: dict = {\\"prompt_tokens\\": 0, \\"completion_tokens\\": 0, \\"total_tokens\\": 0}\\n\\n\\nrouter = APIRouter()\\n\\n\\nasync def generate_chunk_based_response(body, text) -> Generator[str, Any, None]:\\n    yield \\"event: completion\\\\ndata: \\" + json.dumps(\\n        {\\n            \\"id\\": str(uuid.uuid4()),\\n            \\"model\\": body.model,\\n            \\"object\\": \\"chat.completion\\",\\n            \\"choices\\": [\\n                {\\n                    \\"role\\": \\"assistant\\",\\n                    \\"index\\": 1,\\n                    \\"delta\\": {\\"role\\": \\"assistant\\", \\"content\\": text},\\n                    \\"finish_reason\\": \\"stop\\",\\n                }\\n            ],\\n            \\"usage\\": {\\"prompt_tokens\\": 0, \\"completion_tokens\\": 0, \\"total_tokens\\": 0},\\n        }\\n    ) + \\"\\\\n\\\\n\\"\\n    yield \\"event: done\\\\ndata: [DONE]\\\\n\\\\n\\"\\n\\n\\n@router.post(\\"/chat/completions\\", response_model=ChatCompletionResponse)\\nasync def chat_completions(body: ChatCompletionInput) -> Dict[str, Any]:\\n    try:\\n        predictions = model.generate(\\n            messages=body.messages,\\n            temperature=body.temperature,\\n            top_p=body.top_p,\\n            n=body.n,\\n            stream=body.stream,\\n            max_tokens=body.max_tokens,\\n            stop=body.stop,\\n        )\\n        if body.stream:\\n            return StreamingResponse(\\n                generate_chunk_based_response(body, predictions[0]),\\n                media_type=\\"text/event-stream\\",\\n            )\\n        return ChatCompletionResponse(\\n            id=str(uuid.uuid4()),\\n            model=os.getenv(\\"MODEL_ID\\", \\"tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct\\"),\\n            object=\\"chat.completion\\",\\n            created=int(dt.now().timestamp()),\\n            choices=[\\n                {\\n                    \\"role\\": \\"assistant\\",\\n                    \\"index\\": idx,\\n                    \\"message\\": {\\"role\\": \\"assistant\\", \\"content\\": text},\\n                    \\"finish_reason\\": \\"stop\\",\\n                }\\n                for idx, text in enumerate(predictions)\\n            ],\\n            usage={\\"prompt_tokens\\": 0, \\"completion_tokens\\": 0, \\"total_tokens\\": 0},\\n        )\\n    except ValueError as error:\\n        raise HTTPException(\\n            status_code=400,\\n            detail={\\"message\\": str(error)},\\n        )\\n\\n```\\n\\n#### 4. Create `main.py` file.\\n\\nThe `main.py` file is the entry point for our FastAPI application. It is responsible for setting up the application and starting the server.\\n\\nOne important aspect of this file is the `create_start_app_handler` function. This function is designed to be called when the FastAPI application starts up. It creates a function, `start_app`, that is responsible for loading the Falcon 7B Instruction model into memory. This is done by calling the `get_model` method of the `FalconBasedModel` class.\\n\\nThe reason we load the model into memory at startup is to improve the performance of our application. Loading a model is a time-consuming operation. If we were to load the model every time we needed to use it, it would significantly slow down our application. By loading the model at startup, we ensure that it\'s done only once, no matter how many requests our application needs to handle.\\n\\nThe `start_app` function is then returned and registered as a startup event handler for our FastAPI application. This means that FastAPI will automatically call this function when the application starts up, ensuring that our model is loaded and ready to use.\\n\\nThe rest of the `main.py` file is responsible for setting up the FastAPI application, including registering our API routes and setting up CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware. Finally, if this file is run directly (i.e., it is the main module), it starts the FastAPI server using uvicorn.\\n\\n```python\\nimport logging\\nfrom typing import Callable\\n\\nimport uvicorn\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\\nfrom routes import router as api_router\\n\\nfrom models import FalconBasedModel\\n\\ndef create_start_app_handler(app: FastAPI) -> Callable[[], None]:\\n    def start_app() -> None:\\n        FalconBasedModel.get_model()\\n\\n    return start_app\\n\\n\\ndef get_application() -> FastAPI:\\n    application = FastAPI(title=\\"prem-chat-falcon\\", debug=True, version=\\"0.0.1\\")\\n    application.include_router(api_router, prefix=\\"/v1\\")\\n    application.add_event_handler(\\"startup\\", create_start_app_handler(application))\\n    application.add_middleware(\\n        CORSMiddleware,\\n        allow_origins=[\\"*\\"],\\n        allow_credentials=True,\\n        allow_methods=[\\"*\\"],\\n        allow_headers=[\\"*\\"],\\n    )\\n    return application\\n\\n\\napp = get_application()\\n\\n\\nif __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\\n    uvicorn.run(\\"main:app\\", host=\\"0.0.0.0\\", port=8000)\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Use Docker to build and run the application\\n\\nTo build and run the application, we will first create a `download.py` file. This script will be called at build time to download the model and cache it in the Docker image.\\n\\nNext, we will create a Dockerfile that uses the official image from HuggingFace, which includes all the necessary dependencies. This Dockerfile will define the steps to build our Docker image.\\n\\nTo avoid including any unused files in the build process, we will also create a `.dockerignore` file.\\n\\n#### 1. Create a `download.py` file.\\n\\nThe download script will be called at build time to download the model and cache it in the Docker image.\\n\\n```python\\nimport argparse\\nimport os\\n\\nimport torch\\nimport transformers\\nfrom tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_fixed\\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\\n\\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\\nparser.add_argument(\\"--model\\", help=\\"Model to download\\")\\nargs = parser.parse_args()\\n\\nprint(f\\"Downloading model {args.model}\\")\\n\\n\\n@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_fixed(5))\\ndef download_model() -> None:\\n    _ = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(args.model, trust_remote_code=True)\\n    _ = transformers.pipeline(\\n        model=args.model,\\n        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\\n        trust_remote_code=True,\\n        device_map=os.getenv(\\"DEVICE\\", \\"auto\\"),\\n    )\\n\\n\\ndownload_model()\\n\\n```\\n\\n#### 2. Create a `Dockerfile`.\\n\\n```dockerfile\\nFROM huggingface/transformers-pytorch-gpu:4.28.1\\n\\nARG MODEL_ID\\n\\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app/\\n\\nCOPY requirements.txt ./\\n\\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r ./requirements.txt --upgrade pip\\n\\nCOPY download.py .\\n\\nRUN python3 download.py --model $MODEL_ID\\n\\nCOPY . .\\n\\nENV MODEL_ID=$MODEL_ID\\n\\nCMD python3 main.py\\n```\\n\\n#### 4. Create a `.dockerignore` file.\\n\\n```dockerfile\\n.editorconfig\\n.gitattributes\\n.github\\n.gitignore\\n.gitlab-ci.yml\\n.idea\\n.pre-commit-config.yaml\\n.readthedocs.yml\\n.travis.yml\\nvenv\\n.git\\n./ml/models/\\n.bin\\n```\\n\\n### Step 4: Build and run the application\\n\\nFinally, we will build the Docker image using the `docker build` command and run it using the `docker run` command.\\n\\n#### 1. Build the Docker image.\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker build --file ./Dockerfile \\\\\\n    --build-arg=\\"MODEL_ID=tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct\\" \\\\\\n    --tag blog-post/chat-falcon-7b-instruct-gpu:latest \\\\\\n    --tag blog-post/chat-falcon-7b-instruct-gpu:0.0.1 \\\\\\n    .\\n```\\n\\n#### 2. Run the Docker image.\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 blog-post/chat-falcon-7b-instruct-gpu:latest\\n```\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we have demonstrated how to serve the Falcon 7B Instruction model using FastAPI and Docker. This is a crucial first step in serving a model for production use cases.

It is a great tool for students, researchers, and anyone who wants to learn more about a topic.\\n\\n### What is Prem?\\n\\nPrem is a self-hosted AI platform that allows you to test and deploy open-source AI models on your own infrastructure. Prem is open-source and free to use. You can learn more about Prem [here](https://premai.io).\\n\\n## Build Perplexity AI with Prem\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nFor this tutorial we are going to use the **fantastic** open-source frontend [Clarity AI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/clarity-ai) built by [Mckay Wrigley](https://github.com/mckaywrigley). \ud83d\udc4f Kudos for building such a great tool!\\n\\nSince `ClarityAI` uses ChatGPT by OpenAI, the integration with Prem it\'s staightforward as we only need to change the API endpoint and use a random string as API key, to skip the authentication.\\n\\nAs infrastructure, we are going to use [Paperspace Cloud](https://www.paperspace.com/gpu-cloud). You can use any other cloud provider or your own server with a NVIDIA GPU.\\n\\n\\n### Step 1: Little tweaks to the Clarity AI app\\n\\n> \u2139\ufe0f **skip this step** You can use directly my own `clarity-ai` fork [github.com/tiero/clarity-ai](https://github.com/tiero/clarity-ai) that has the changes already applied.\\n\\n#### 1. Clone the app\\n\\nFirst, we need to clone the Clarity AI repository. For future reference, we are using the follwing commit hash [`5a33db1`](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/clarity-ai/commit/5a33db140d253f47da3f07ad1475938c14dfda45).\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/mckaywrigley/clarity-ai\\n```\\nOpen the `clarity-ai` project with your editor of choice. I\'m using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\\n\\n\\n#### 2. Set a random API key\\n\\nOpen the `components/Search.tsx` file, at line 16 we need to pre-populate the `apiKey` state with a random string. \\n\\n```typescript\\nconst [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState<string>(\\"X\\".repeat(51));\\n```\\nThis is needed because we are not going to use the authentication system of OpenAI and Prem is currently exposing the endpoints without authentication.\\n\\n#### 3. Set the API endpoint\\n\\nOpen the `utils/answer.ts` file, at line 8 we need to change the API endpoint from OpenAI to be sourced from environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`\\n\\n```typescript\\n`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/v1/chat/completions`\\n```\\n\\nDone! \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n### Step 2: Install Prem on Paperspace\\n\\n\\nCreate a Paperspace account if you don\'t have one already, then login to the [Paperspace Console](https://console.paperspace.com/).\\n\\n#### 1. Create a machine \\n\\n- **Machine Type**: `P6000`, `V100-32G`, `A100`, `A100-80G`, `A5000`, `A6000`\\n- **GPU**: `NVIDIA GPU`\\n- **Machine OS**: `ML-in-a-Box`\\n- **Machine Storage**: `50 GB`\\n- **Memory**: min 24 GiB\\n\\n#### 2. Connect to the instance via SSH\\n\\n```bash\\nssh paperspace@<your-instance-ip>\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. Install Prem\\n\\n```bash\\nwget -q https://get.prem.ninja/install.sh -O install.sh; sudo bash ./install.sh\\n```\\nThis can take a while, so grab an espresso \u2615\ufe0f\\n\\n#### 4. Check the app\\n\\nVisit the following URL in your browser: `http://<your-instance-ip>:8000` to confirm the Prem App is up and running.\\n\\n### Step 3: Download & Run the model \\n\\nFrom the Prem App, select the `Dolly v2 12B` model and click on the **dowload** icon.\\nOnce the model is downloaded, click **Open** button. This will start the container and open the chat UI. At this point we don\'t need the embedded user interface, so we can close it.\\n\\n### Step 4: Run the app\\n\\nNow back to the frontend, let\'s run it locally and connect to our Prem instance.\\n\\n#### 1. Set the right environment variable \\n\\n```bash\\nexport NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://<your-instance-ip>:8000\\n```\\n\\n#### 2. Install the dependencies\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. Run the frontend\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run dev\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Enjoy!\\n\\nVisit the following URL in your browser: `http://localhost:3000` to start using your own Perplexity AI clone!"},{"id":"hello-prem","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/hello-prem","editUrl":"https://github.com/premAI-io/dev-portal/blob/main/blog/2023-06-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Hello Prem!","description":"Hello, I am Filippo and I am currently contributing to Prem.","date":"2023-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"llm","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"},{"label":"self-hosted","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-hosted"},{"label":"prem","permalink":"/blog/tags/prem"},{"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"welcome","permalink":"/blog/tags/welcome"}],"readingTime":0.345,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Pedrazzini","title":"Core contributor @ PremAI","url":"https://github.com/filopedraz","imageURL":"https://github.com/filopedraz.png","key":"filippopedrazzinfp"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hello-prem","title":"Hello Prem!","authors":["filippopedrazzinfp"],"tags":["llm","self-hosted","prem","open-source","welcome"],"description":"Hello, I am Filippo and I am currently contributing to Prem.","image":"./banner.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Build a Perplexity AI clone on Prem","permalink":"/blog/perplexity-ai-self-hosted"}},"content":"\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n![Prem Banner](./banner.png)\\n\\nHello, I am Filippo and I am currently contributing to Prem.\\n\\nWelcome to Prem!\\n\\n- Be part of the community [joining our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kpKk6vYVAn).\\n- To stay in touch [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/premai_io).\\n- To report bugs or ask for support [open an issue on the Github repository](https://github.com/premAI-io/prem-app).\\n\\nWe just released the first version of our Developer Portal.
