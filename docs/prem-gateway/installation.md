Prem App and Prem Daemon can run without Prem-Gateway.
However, if you want to use Prem App and Prem Daemon in the Cloud environment, it is recommended to install Prem Gateway cause of its features.<br/>
It is enough to choose y/Y when prompted to install Prem Gateway during the installation of Prem App or Prem Daemon. 

```bash
wget -q https://get.prem.ninja/install.sh -O install.sh; sudo bash ./install.sh
```

Note that after installation is done, username and password, that is needed to access Prem App, will be printed out.
